During the completion of this assignment, I used ChatGPT as a learning support tool. 

Specifically, I asked ChatGPT which API provided by Open-Meteo would be appropriate for weather finder, how to look up the API usage and parameters, and how to locate and read the official documentation on the Open-Meteo website. 


In addition, for the page layout and visual design, I referenced the overall layout style of Apple’s official website. 

I also used Google Search to look up the color schemes used on Apple’s official webpages, including background colors and card-style component colors. 

These references were used solely for design inspiration.
